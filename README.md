# K-Sense: A Non-Invasive eBPF Framework for QoS Inference

This repository contains the reference implementation for K-Sense, a non-invasive
eBPF-based framework that infers QoS degradation from kernel behavior by computing
a covariance-aware friction signal (Mahalanobis distance) plus a directional sign
and an adaptive energy signal.

Paper status: This work is under review for IEEE ICFE 2026.

## Layout

- `src/ksense/` Python package (BPF program, helpers, energy model, plotting, main loop)
- `main.py` Entry point script
- `scripts/monitor_cpu_psi.py` CPU + PSI monitoring helper script
- `scripts/step_response_prober.py` Step-response load generator for 3 apps (per-second CSV)
- `scripts/latency_p99_prober.py` Parallel P99 latency prober for 3 apps (per-interval CSV)
- `node_collector/` Node-level syscall + kernel signal collector (eBPF)
- `graph/` Analysis outputs and plotting scripts

## Run

```bash
sudo -E python3 main.py
```

Node-level collector:

```bash
sudo -E python3 node_collector/main.py
```

Scripts:

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor_cpu_psi.py
python3 scripts/step_response_prober.py
python3 scripts/latency_p99_prober.py
```

## Research Context (IEEE Paper Summary)

K-Sense targets edge environments where applications are often black boxes and
application-level instrumentation is impractical. It relies on a small set of
kernel-level delay signals (CPU scheduling latency, SoftIRQ processing time, and
D-state I/O latency) and models the system state as a point in a multi-dimensional
feature space. The deviation from a calibrated baseline is quantified using the
Mahalanobis distance (friction), while a direction sign indicates whether the
system is above or below the baseline. An adaptive energy signal captures short-
term instability in friction.

The framework is evaluated with real workloads (DeathStarBench microservices and
a sentiment-analysis application). Results show that friction tracks application
P99 latency under changing load and remains informative when CPU utilization and
PSI saturate, enabling non-invasive QoS inference for admission control and
scheduling decisions.

## Notes

- Requires `bcc`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` (for plotting).
- Run with appropriate privileges for eBPF (typically `sudo`).
